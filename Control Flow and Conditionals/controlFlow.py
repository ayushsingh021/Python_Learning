##########   ELSE IF ###############

# The for...else loop in Python allows you to execute a block of code in the else clause after the loop has completed its iteration. The else block is executed only if the loop completes without encountering a break statement.

# break and continue works statement are same 
    

#pass
# The pass statement allows you to run through the loop in its entirety and effectively ignore that the if condition has been satisfied.
